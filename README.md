# Cooktops
# Abstract

Our project is to identify people's preferences for different types of stoves --Gas, Electric and Induction. The motivation behind this study is the US Government's proposed shift to transition from gas to electric/induction stoves for safety and environmental reasons.

Our preliminary research about [Cooktop types](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t7P-EwncM1di8XoGIacFEEggvDJcXtPfUdSaPnEAlM4/edit?usp=sharing) helped us determine the features people are interested in while purchasing cooking stoves: Type, Final Cost, Number of Burners, Average Annual Usage Cost and Indoor Air Quality. Using these attributes, we are designing a survey and will be performing a Conjoint analysis of the results to better understand user preferences. The eventual goal is to be able to provide insights to policymakers for refining existing policies and facilitating a smooth shift from gas to electricity. Some of the insights we have gained from our pilot analysis were including both gender and Age in the preliminary questions would help us better understand our audience and that our exclusion criteria in the survey design should only be for underage individuals as we have limited resources for conducting surveys. The exclusion criteria of residence in the DMV region and Home Ownership should ideally be moved upstream to the respondents' selection platform ie. MTurk

# Introduction

Cooking is an essential part of daily life, and the cooktop individuals choose can significantly impact their culinary experience. Whether an individual is a professional chef or simply enjoys preparing meals at home, their preferences for cooktop types can vary widely. On the other hand, the shift from traditional gas stoves to induction or electric stoves has been a rising debate among climate advocates who have been proposing a reduction of fossil fuel usage. Considering all these factors, the US government brought in a law [(Inflation Reduction Act 2022)](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_of_2022.pdf) which amongst many other considerations is subsidies to homeowners who switch from gas to Electric/Induction Stoves.

The motivation behind our study is the proposed shift from gas to electric/Induction and the practical challenges that will come during its implementation. There is a genuine individual safety concern with gas cooktops and their adverse effects on the environment, on the other hand, the concerns of the people who are being asked to switch are equally valid. The cost differential, reliability, and efficacy while preparing certain cuisines are just some of the primary concerns that come up when considering a transition from gas to electric/induction.

### Type of Cooktops:

-   Gas Cooktop - Gas Cooktops work on natural gas which is ignited and the flame itself is the source of heat. It was patented by James Sharp in England in 1826 and has been an integral part of most households since the 1920's.

-   Electric Cooktop - Electric cooktops have an electrical current that flows through a metal coil underneath the glass or ceramic surface. The coil becomes hot and starts glowing due to the electrical resistance. It will transfer its heat through the glass using infrared energy. It was patented in 1896 by William Hadaway.

-   Induction Cooktop - Induction cooktops generate heat by combining electricity and the magnetic properties found in most pots and pans. Induction Cooktops were first released to the public at the Chicago "Century of Progress" World's Fair in 1933.
